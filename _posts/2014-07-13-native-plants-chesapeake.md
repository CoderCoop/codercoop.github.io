### Introducing a new Project from CoderCoop

This Android app searches for native plants of the Chesapeake Bay watershed using the [Native Plant Center](http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/) database. of  native plants and allows the user to  from an Android phone., view a picture of the plant, and see details including sunlight and soil requirements. This is an unofficial app and is not endorsed by [Native Plant Center](http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/).

Native plants are species found growing naturally in the wild. They are a smart choice for gardeners because they have adapted to regional weather and soil conditions. Native plants require less care such as watering and fertilizers, and are often more resistant to common diseases and pests. They also have a positive impact on the ecosystem by providing food and habitat for native animals.
