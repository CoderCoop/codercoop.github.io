### Free Android App
Search for native plants of the Chesapeake Bay watershed using the [Native Plant Center](http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/) database. From the search results, you can select a plant by its picture and see more details including sunlight and soil requirements. This is an unofficial app and not endorsed by [Native Plant Center](http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/).

Native plants are species that grow naturally in the wild. Visitors to parks can find these plants in undisturbed areas. They are a smart choice for gardeners because they have adapted to regional weather and soil conditions. They require less care, such as watering and fertilizers, and are often more resistant to common diseases and pests. They also have a positive impact on the ecosystem by providing food and habitat for native animals.

The app [source code](https://github.com/CoderCoop/nativePlantsChesapeake) is publicly available. It was written with HTML and Javascript using [JQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/).
